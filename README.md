## Date created
17 September 2021

## Description
In this project, **Python** is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the **United States of America :**  **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington.**

The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience.
Depending on the user's input, data is imported from source to provide answer to important question with the help of descriptive statistics.

## Software Requirements 
You should have **Python 3, NumPy**, and **pandas** installed using **Anaconda**
A text editor, like **Sublime or Atom**.
A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

## Files used
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
chicago.csv
bikeshare_2.py

## Project Details

### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

### Statistics Computed
Users will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, users will write code to provide the following information:

##### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
>most common month
>most common day of week
>most common hour of day

##### 2 Popular stations and trip
>most common start station
>most common end station
>most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

##### 3 Trip duration
>total travel time
>average travel time

##### 4 User info
>counts of each user type
>counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
>earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
